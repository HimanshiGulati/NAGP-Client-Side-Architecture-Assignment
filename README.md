# Reason to Use SCSS
I have used SCSS because of its following features-- 
1. $variables:  With Sass, we can assign CSS values to variables, meaning that annoying hex color #91ea42 can now be set as a variable for you to reuse whenever you want.
2. @mixins: they work similar to a simple JavaScript function. we can write them to accept arguments or without them too.
3. Nesting: It allows  to nest child selectors within their parent selector. This means we can store all style rules belonging to the same parent or grandparent right under each other.
